# GeneticScheduler
A genetic algorithm to generate theoretical schedules

### How to Run
To run, simple paste this or open the file in a Java compiler. Hit the run button, you will see a formatted schedule with an associated fitness score generated for you in the output console. By default the algorthim is set to a population size of 500, a generation size of 100, and a mutation rate of .01. To edit any of these values, simply alter the first three variables (POPULATION_SIZE, NUM_GENERATIONS, and MUATTION_RATE) inside the GeneticScheduler class and hit the run button again. You will see the schedule and fitness score changed appropriately. 

### Outputs

Generations: 100
